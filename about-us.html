        <h2>Creating stories that build connections</h2>
        <h3>From a 3-person content creation company to a 50-employees team, Spark Copy has always stayed true to our
            commitment to customer-centric content.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2015</strong>: Emma Kim joined forces with two creative partners and took the leap of faith to
                found Spark Copy. By the end of the year, we had already created 1,000 pieces of content for clients in
                various industries, including blog posts, social media posts, and website copy.</li>
            <li><strong>2016</strong>: Kim secured Spark Copy's first funding round, which allowed our team to grow and
                take on more clients.</li>
            <li><strong>2017</strong>: With the added funding, we were able to expand our services to include content
                marketing, helping clients not only create great content but also promote it effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>2019</strong>: We were recognized as one of the fastest-growing content creation companies in
                the country with the Content Marketing Institute's Content Marketing Award for Best Content Creation
                Agency.</li>
            <li><strong>2021</strong>: We celebrated our 6th year in business, having achieved significant milestones in
                helping clients connect with their customers through compelling content. We'll continue to grow our team
                and find new ways to create effective content that sends the right message.</li>
